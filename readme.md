**mpv Broadcast Suite** brings the legendary *mpv* playback core — born from the MPlayer lineage - into a professional broadcast context.  
Designed for engineers who grew up with waveform monitors, colour bars and baseband matrices - yet demand today's precision, scripting power and open workflows.  

Might suit broadcast engineers, QC ops and post-production. Features broadcast-style timecode display, quite advanced multi-channel audio routing, and loudness compliance tooling.

> Built for those who never stopped caring about frame accuracy.

- **Progress Visualisation** - Clean progress bar showing file position
- **Real-Time Metadata** - Elapsed time, countdown timer, FPS indicator, duration display
- **Multiple Display Modes** - Full overlay, TC-only, minimal, and off modes

### Audio Management
- **Multi-Channel Routing** - Flexible channel selection for 8/16-channel embedded audio
- **Stereo Pair Selection** - Direct access to CH1+2, CH3+4, up to CH15+16
- **Solo Monitoring** - Monitor individual channels in isolation (mono→stereo)
- **Intelligent Downmix** - RMS-normalised all-channel summation prevents clipping
- **Loudness Compliance** - Built-in EBU R128, ATSC A/85, and podcast normalisation

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/FiLORUX/mpv-broadcast-suite.git
cd mpv-broadcast-suite

# Run installer
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/FiLORUX/mpv-broadcast-suite.git
cd mpv-broadcast-suite

# Run installer
.\install.ps1
```

**Manual Installation:**
```bash
# Copy files to mpv config directory
cp mpv.conf ~/.config/mpv/
cp input.conf ~/.config/mpv/
cp scripts/*.lua ~/.config/mpv/scripts/
```

### Verification

Launch mpv with any video file:
```bash
mpv your_video.mp4
```

You should see:
- Large timecode display centred at bottom of screen
- Information overlay in top-left corner
- Green progress bar beneath timecode

## ⌨️ Keybindings

All core functions are accessible from the keyboard — designed for operators who prefer precision over menus.

→ [Full reference: docs/KEYBINDINGS.md](docs/KEYBINDINGS.md)

---

## 🎨 Customisation

Every display and routing element can be adjusted through plain-text Lua configuration.  
No GUI layers, no hidden logic — just direct control.

→ [Configuration guide: docs/CUSTOMISATION.md](docs/CUSTOMISATION.md)

---

## 🔧 Technical Details

Framerates, loudness, and multi-channel routing follow established broadcast standards.  
No reinvention, only careful implementation.

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Timecode Not Visible
**Symptom:** No timecode appears when playing file  
**Solution:** Press `t` to cycle display modes (may be set to 'off')  
**Verify:** Check that `timecode.lua` exists in `scripts/` directory

### Audio Routing Ineffective
**Symptom:** Pressing `Ctrl+1-8` has no effect  
**Solution:** Press `Ctrl+i` to verify channel count. If file reports "2 channels", it's already stereo—routing not needed  
**Note:** For files with multiple audio **tracks** (not channels), use `#` to select the track first, then use `Ctrl+1-8` for channel routing within that track

### Drop-Frame Timecode Incorrect
**Symptom:** Timecode appears wrong or doesn't match external reference  
**Solution:** Press `i` to verify actual framerate. Drop-frame only applies to NTSC-derived rates (~23.976, ~29.97, ~59.94)  
**Debug:** Edit `timecode.lua` and adjust tolerance values in `get_fps_info()` if framerate detection is incorrect

### Loudness Filter Causes Performance Issues
**Symptom:** Playback stutters when loudness normalisation enabled  
**Solution:** Loudness filtering is CPU-intensive. Press `Ctrl+l` to cycle to "none" on older hardware  
**Alternative:** Use offline loudness normalisation with dedicated tools for critical listening

### Multiple Audio Tracks Confusion
**Symptom:** Cannot access expected channels  
**Solution:** Distinguish between **tracks** (separate audio streams) and **channels** (within a track):
- Use `#` to cycle between tracks
- Use `Ctrl+1-8` to route channels within the active track
- Press `Ctrl+i` to see track count and channel layout
